# Weighted-Adaptive-Optimal-Transport
This is the code for my summer research project with AM-SURE. Thank you to Dr. Esteban Tabak, and Dr. Debra Laefer for their support in this project. 


For a descriptive overview of my research please refer to presentation: "Presentation_AMSURE.pdf". For a more technical, in-depth overview please refer to the paper: "Weighted_Adaptive_Optimal_Transport.pdf". 


To look into the code I worked on, please check the folder main code for the source code of the algorithm. The Gradient Dependencies folder is neccesary to run the gh.m method in this folder.
