# Weighted-Adaptive-Optimal-Transport
This is the code for my summer research project with AM-SURE. Thank you to Dr. Esteban Tabak, and Dr. Debra Laefer for their support in this project. 


For a descriptive overview of my research please refer to my joint presentation with Alexandre Milewski: "Presentation_AMSURE.pdf". For a more technical, in-depth overview please refer to the paper: "Weighted_Adaptive_Optimal_Transport.pdf". 

To check out a small sample of the video expeirements I created on the code in action, look at the "Videos" folder.

To look into the code I worked on, please check the folder main code for the source code of the algorithm. The Gradient Dependencies folder is neccesary to run the gh.m method in this folder. 

A breif thanks to all those involved in making the AM-SURE program so successful and to NSF grant #1646339 for providing the  funding for my summer internship. Thank you also to Dr. Monty Essid for providing support during the initial stages of my research and my research group partners for helping me push through conceptual and technical hurdles.
